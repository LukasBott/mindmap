Sierpinski Mind Map
Version 0.1:
- works with chrome
- works only restricted with firefox: close menu button does not hide dialog

This is an application written in JavaScript using the HTML canvas to visualize a hierarchical graph (HG).

A main goal was, that HG of any size could be visualized.
The user should be able to go to every node and edit it.
Graphs should be saveable and loadable. The concept Sierpinski triangle/graph is used for getting drawing rules of children nodes. This makes it possible to visualize hierarchical graphs of infinite sizes (theoretically). The whole framework is embedded inside an HTML file.
For usage:

1. Download <b>SierpinskyMindmap.html</b>
2. Open <b>SierpinskyMindmap.html</b> with a browser (better use chrome but i am working on it)
