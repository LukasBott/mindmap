This is an application written in JavaScript using the HTML canvas to visualize a hierarchical graph (HG).

A main goal was, that HG of any size could be visualized.
The user should be able to go to every node and edit it.
Graphs should be saveable and loadable. The concept Sierpinski triangle/graph is used for getting drawing rules of children nodes. This makes it possible to visualize hierarchical graphs of infinite sizes (theoretically). The whole framework is embedded inside an HTML file.

## For usage and tutorial:
- Click on node to move to it
- Double click on node to edit it
- Right click on node to open nodes link
